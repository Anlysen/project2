            Alaska (/əˈlæskə/ (listen) ə-LAS-kə; Aleut: Alax̂sxax̂; Inupiaq: Alaasikaq;
             Alutiiq: Alas'kaaq; Yup'ik: Alaskaq;[4] Tlingit: Anáaski) is a U.S. state
              located in the Western United States on the northwest extremity
               of North America. A semi-exclave of the U.S., it borders the Canadian 
               province of British Columbia and the territory of Yukon to the east and 
               shares a maritime border with the Russian Federation's Chukotka
                Autonomous Okrug to the west, just across the Bering Strait. To the 
                north are the Chukchi and Beaufort seas of the Arctic Ocean, while the
                 Pacific Ocean lies to the south and southwest.

            Alaska is by far the largest U.S. state by area, comprising more total area than the next three largest states
             (Texas, California, and Montana) combined. It represents the seventh largest subnational division in the world. 
             It is the third-least populous and the most sparsely populated state, but by far the continent's most populous
              territory located mostly north of the 60th parallel, with a population of 736,081 as of 2020—more than quadruple the
               combined populations of Northern Canada and Greenland.[3]

            Approximately half of Alaska's residents live within the Anchorage metropolitan area. The state capital of Juneau is
             the second-largest city in the United States by area, comprising more territory than the states of Rhode Island and
              Delaware. The former capital of Alaska, Sitka, is the largest U.S. city by area.

              What is now Alaska has been home to various indigenous peoples for thousands of years; it is widely
               believed that the region served as the entry point for the initial settlement of North America by way
                of the Bering land bridge. The Russian Empire was the first to actively colonize the area beginning in the
                 18th century, eventually establishing Russian America, which spanned most of the current state. The expense 
                 and difficulty of maintaining this distant possession prompted its sale to the U.S. in 1867 for US$7.2 million 
                 (equivalent to $140 million in 2021), or approximately two cents per acre ($4.74/km2).

              The area went through several administrative changes before becoming organized as a territory on May 11,
               1912. It was admitted as the 49th state of the U.S. on January 3, 1959.[5]

              While it has one of the smallest state economies in the country, Alaska's per capita income is among the highest,
               owing to a diversified economy dominated by fishing, natural gas, and oil, all of which it has in abundance.
                United States armed forces bases and tourism are also a significant part of the economy; more than half
                 the state is federally owned public land, including a multitude of national forests, national parks, and 
                 wildlife refuges.

                  The indigenous population of Alaska is proportionally the highest of any U.S. state, at over 15 percent.
                  [6] Close to two dozen native languages are spoken, and Alaskan Natives exercise considerable influence 
                  in local and state politics.

    Numerous indigenous peoples occupied Alaska for thousands of years before the arrival of European peoples to the area.
     Linguistic and DNA studies done here have provided evidence for the settlement of North America by way of the Bering 
     land bridge.[10] At the Upward Sun River site in the Tanana Valley in Alaska, remains of a six-week-old infant were found. 
     The baby's DNA showed that she belonged to a population that was genetically separate from other native groups present
      elsewhere in the New World at the end of the Pleistocene. Ben Potter, the University of Alaska Fairbanks archaeologist
       who unearthed the remains at the Upward Sun River site in 2013, named this new group Ancient Beringians.[11]

                  The Tlingit people developed a society with a matrilineal kinship system of property inheritance 
                  and descent in what is today Southeast Alaska, along with parts of British Columbia and the Yukon.
                   Also in Southeast were the Haida, now well known for their unique arts.

                  The Tsimshian people came to Alaska from British Columbia in 1887, when President Grover Cleveland,
                  and later the U.S. Congress, granted them permission to settle on Annette Island and found the
                   town of Metlakatla.

                  All three of these peoples, as well as other indigenous peoples of the Pacific Northwest Coast, 
                  experienced smallpox outbreaks from the late 18th through the mid-19th century, with the most devastating
                  epidemics occurring in the 1830s and 1860s, resulting in high fatalities and social disruption.[12]

                  The Aleutian Islands are still home to the Aleut people's seafaring society, although they were the
                   first Native Alaskans to be exploited by the Russians. Western and Southwestern Alaska are home to
                    the Yup'ik, while their cousins the Alutiiq ~ Sugpiaq live in what is now Southcentral Alaska. The
                     Gwich'in people of the northern Interior region are Athabaskan and primarily known today for their
                      dependence on the caribou within the much-contested Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.
